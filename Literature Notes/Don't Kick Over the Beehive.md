## Part One: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People
---
### Notes:
This chapter is all about [[Criticism]]. Criticizing others builds resentment and does not usually change the way they see themselves. Most individuals do not see what they are doing is wrong, or how they could have done anything differently. 

[[Abraham Lincoln]] serves as an example of a man who previously criticized people harshly, until he faced a duel, and then began to stop criticizing people to their faces, and instead would write letters, but never send them. **Criticism tends to make the criticizer feel better about themselves, but is almost always harmful the individual being criticized.** [[Mark Twain]]'s wife would pull his critical letters out of the mail so that he would not hurt those that were important to him in his career. Learning to control your criticism of others requires a great deal of self control. 

[[Benjamin Franklin]] became a great diplomat by adhering to the standard, "I will speak ill of no man, and speak all the good I know of everybody."

[[Dale Carnegie]] references [[Father Forgets]], an American short story about a father holding his son up to the standards of a grown man rather than a child. 

Carnegie ends this chapter noting that we should try to foster understanding of individuals rather than condemning others.  Culminating in [[#Principle 1]]

### Quote(s):
- "Criticism is Futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself." (Page 33)
- "Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment" (Page 34)
- "Criticisms are like homing pigeons. They always return home. Let's realize that the person we are going to correct and condemn will probably justify himself or herself, and condemn us in return." (Page 36)
- "Sharp criticisms and rebukes almost invariably end in futility." (Page 40)
- "When dealing with people, let us remember that we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity." (Page 42)
