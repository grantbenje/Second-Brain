Title: The Hunger - A Dread RPG Scenario

**Overview:** This is a horror-themed Dread RPG scenario designed for 4–6 players. Inspired by the core theme of _The Hunger_, this story revolves around isolation, desperation, and the monstrous urges that grow when survival is on the line. The players will confront psychological and physical horror in a high-stakes survival situation.

---

**Setting:** A secluded forest campground in the Great Lakes region, early spring. What begins as a lighthearted college spring break trip devolves into a nightmare. After a series of unfortunate events—car breakdowns, disappearing phones, and a run-in with a strange hermit—the group is stranded miles from civilization. As they try to find a way out, they begin to suspect something ancient and malevolent is stalking them.

---

**Tone:** Campy but cruel. A blend of lighthearted slasher-film humor and crushing folk-horror dread. The first act might feel like a cheesy horror flick, but it rapidly descends into paranoia, fear, and raw survival. Expect references to college life, sarcasm, and party culture—but with an undercurrent of deep unease and folklore-based horror.

---

**Characters:** Each character is defined by a questionnaire exploring their relationships, fears, skills, and personal history. Core roles might include:

- The Party Animal
- The Academic
- The Influencer
- The Local
- The Skeptic
- The Tagalong

Each role has secrets and vulnerabilities to exploit as the scenario unfolds.

---

**Core Conflict:** Survival vs. Humanity. As the players confront fear, confusion, and an unseen threat, they are driven to make increasingly desperate decisions. The folklore becomes real—or at least real enough to kill. Trust fractures. Bodies vanish. Something hungers in the woods.

---

**Threats:**

- **The Forest**: Ever-shifting paths, strange sounds, oppressive silence.
- **The Isolation**: No signal, no way back, no help.
- **The Hunger**: Something is feeding—and it might be them.
- **The Folklore**: Native legends (Wendigo, Deer Woman, Skinwalkers) echo through the trees. Are they real, or hallucinations?
- **Each Other**: Paranoia runs rampant. Who is acting strange? Who’s been "touched" by the forest?

---

**Structure:**

1. **Arrival at the Campsite** – Drinking, partying, and dumb decisions. Tension brews under the fun.
2. **The Storm** – Vehicles are flooded, the bridge is out. No contact with the outside world.
3. **Something in the Trees** – One of them goes missing. Strange symbols are found. Animal bones. Dreams of hunger.
4. **Fracture** – Accusations fly. Factions form. Some want to leave; others think staying put is safer.
5. **The Legend Comes Alive** – They remember the old stories, the warnings, the curses. Now they believe.
6. **The Hunger** – Hallucinations. Starvation. Betrayal. Blood. The truth is too awful to face.

---

**Key Themes for Player Experience:**

- Isolation and unreliable reality
- Cultural appropriation vs. truth
- The descent from party fun to psychological horror
- Inner conflict: fear, guilt, hunger

---

**Player Questions (Sample):**

- What’s the real reason you came on this trip?
- What Native myth did you hear growing up—and why does it scare you?
- Who do you have a crush on in the group, and what are you hiding from them?
- Have you ever done something you swore you'd never do again?
- Why do you feel like something is watching you, even when you're alone?

---

**GM Guidance:**

- Let the characters’ bonds deteriorate as the pressure builds.
- Introduce folklore elements slowly: whispers in Ojibwe, warnings from old locals, animal behavior.
- Keep the threat ambiguous: is it a spirit, a curse, or madness?
- Let players spiral—pulls for panic, guilt, hunger, and betrayal.

**ACT I**

1. Intro Scene
    
    A. Have the Characters describe themselves and establish what they know about each other.  
    B. This could happen on the drive to the campsite—maybe a feeling of being followed or watched begins here. One character might spot what looks like an old sign half-buried in the brush, reading something like "Haver Hill Cabin – 3 mi" with an arrow pointing down a narrow, overgrown side road.  
    C. Make sure they notice this road, a mile or two before their destination. It looks abandoned, but could be remembered later as a possible haven—or lure. 
    
2. Once the party arrives at the campsite, they begin to have a generally good night of drinking and partying, Some of them might notice eyes glowing in the treeline for brief moments.   
    A. Focus on Terror, avoid any direct confrontations  
    B. Build hysteria.
    
3. When they wake up much of their food has been destroyed. Some of it on the ground, some opened and emptied, like it has been eaten in the night. Some of it is just gone. 
    
4. They notice at this point that their tents have cuts in them. Maybe they hadn't noticed last night, but something happened, and they won't protect from any rain. 
    
5. As they attempt to recover from their hangovers, they discover that their phones no longer have signal—even though they had service yesterday. Attempts to walk out to higher ground fail. One phone might receive a distorted emergency broadcast before going dead. The group begins to suspect some kind of interference—or worse, deliberate blocking.
    
6. The group's vehicle (or vehicles) won't start. Possible reasons include:
    
    - A dead battery, inexplicably drained overnight
        
    - Keys gone missing after the party
        
7. Weather starts turning bad around noon. Players at this point remember that sign about the cabin. 
    
8. While searching for a way out, one of the players finds a crude, carved wooden totem hanging from a tree—something they don't remember seeing before. As they follow a strange compulsion (or maybe a sound only they hear), they discover a faint footpath that seems oddly familiar. After a moment of recognition, someone recalls it points toward the side road they saw earlier—the one marked "Haver Hill Cabin." This path, they realize, may lead back to that possible haven. Whether it truly offers safety or something far worse remains to be seen.
    

ACT II

1. The party arrives at the Haver Hill cabin, night is starting to fall in the forest, and they notice that there is some flickering light coming from inside the cabin. There is no vehicle or anything here, but some smoke coming out of the chimney. It generally looks welcoming, but someone lives here for sure. 
    
2. The hermit lives here, and he is friendly enough, but really weird. He offers water and food, but then explains that he will have to go out to hunt for some more provisions, and that his phone is knocked out by the storm. (The storm has just barely started)

**Conclusion:** This scenario ends in one of two ways: a lucky escape—or a harrowing decision that leaves scars. Survival isn't about beating the monster. It's about what you’ll become to make it out.
