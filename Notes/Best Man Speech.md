Tomorrow Boy
- Growing up, we would call Gabe Tomorrow Boy, because he would always tend to say that he would do things tomorrow instead of now. It was his way of procrastinating things he did not want to do. 
- He didn't procrastinate when it came to Kailynn
	- He wasted no time as soon as he knew what he wanted
	- No longer Tomorrowboy
- Urge to hold on to the Tomorrow boy ideals, but reframe: He now has every tomorrow to look forward to, for the rest of his life. He should strive to make every tomorrow the best day ever.
