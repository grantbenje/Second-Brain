1. PTO
	1. Wedding (Oct 5) - Need **Sept. 30-Oct. 7**
	2. Honeymoon - Need **Nov. 11-Nov.15**
	3. Family Vacation - Need **Apr. 21-Apr. 25**
	4. December - My wife gets either the week of Christmas, OR the week of News years off, and we are not sure which yet. We may want to go visit family.
	   
	   Ideally, I'd like to take this same week off, IF we end up having plans to visit family, but understand that this is a lot of PTO to request with a new job. What are the policies around working from anywhere, with this being a remote position and all? For example, If I want to go visit my family in Oregon, can I go do that without taking PTO provided that I still work 8 hours a day from Oregon? ect. ect. 
2. September Travel to HQ
3. What is my actual first day going to look like? I have a meeting at 11am. Would I be able to go to an appointment that morning?
