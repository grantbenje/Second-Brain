- **Gateways** - receive messages from end devices and forward them to the Network Server.
- **Network Server** - a piece of software running on a server that manages the entire network.
- **Application servers** - a piece of software running on a server that is responsible for securely processing application data.
- **Join Server** - a piece of software running on a server that processes join-request messages sent by end devices (The Join Server is not shown in the above figure).
